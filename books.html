  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Maskiner der tænker</h2>
    <h3>Algoritmernes hemmeligheder og vejen til kunstig intelligens</h3>
    <h4>Inga Strümke, 2024</h4>
    <p>I loved this book! Inge Strümke is a Norwegian physicist thoroughly explaining AI in a way even non-techies can understand. I felt both very entertained and intrigued the whole book through, and will probably read it again soon. For anyone who is curious (or even a little afraid of) AI technology and how it works.</p>

  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Wintering</h2>
    <h3>The power of rest and retreat in difficult times</h3>
    <h4>Katherine May, 2024</h4>
    <p>I read this book at a perfect time, when all I wanted to do was sit inside and craft and read and drink coffee under a warm blanket. Katherine May describes her own internal winter through beautiful nature metaphors and anecdotes and it's the perfect book to read if you want to slow down and turn inwards.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/the-dispossessed.jpg" alt="The Dispossessed book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The Dispossessed</h2>
    <h4>Ursula K. Le Guin, 1974</h4>
    <p>I loooooove Ursula Le Guin, her books speak to my soul! This one especially since it transports us to a world structured on anarchist principles and the social commentary is amazing. The way she paints the contrasting capitalist world is hilarious (and a little sad since we are totally living in it), and I could read it again and again.</p>
  </div>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/manhunt.jpg" alt="Manhunt book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Manhunt</h2>
    <h4>Gretchen Felker-Martin, 2022</h4>
    <p>This books is both incredibly funny, scary, thought-provoking, heartbreaking and everything in between. I was laughing and crying in tandem. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone with a certain level of testosterone in their body has been overcome by a wild virus, and written from the perspective of two incredible trans women, you get the thrill of body horror and the tender trans experience all mixed up in love stories and friendships and an absolutely hilarious scene where J.K. Rowling is violently murdered (sorry for the spoiler). Just read it.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/bluewater.jpg" alt="The Year of Blue Water book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The Year of Blue Water</h2>
    <h4>Yanyi, 2019</h4>
    <p>Beautiful poems by trans writer and poet, Yanyi. I keep coming back to this collection, because it so effortlessly captures moving between identities and the uncertainty of that.</p>
  </div>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/translationstate.jpg" alt="Translation State book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Translation State</h2>
    <h4>Ann Leckie, 2023</h4>
    <p>OK, this is not my favourite scifi of all time, but something I think Ann Leckie did really well and that I enjoyed very much was the fluidity of gender in the characters of this story. Definitely worth a read!</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/earthsea.jpg" alt="The Books of Earthsea book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The Books of Earthsea</h2>
    <h4>Ursula K. Le Guin, 1968-2001</h4>
    <p>So, this book series is actually 5 different books written over a span of 40 years (!!). It's incredible. I read all five books in one summer, and I was so sad to be done. If you love Harry Potter but hate J.K. Rowling, these books are for you. If you love Lord of The Rings, but you want strong female characters, these books are for you.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/dawn.jpg" alt="Dawn book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Dawn</h2>
    <h3>A Lilith's Brood novel</h3>
    <h4>Octavia E. Butler, 1987</h4>
    <p>Ooof this book was surprisingly hot. Human-alien relationships, extremely descriptive alien worlds, non-binarism and polyamory, black female lead, all great things about this book. It is part of a three book series (I have not read the sequels), so if you like it you can just continue reading.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/thevegetarian.jpg" alt="The Vegetarian book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The Vegetarian</h2>
    <h4>Han Kang, 2007</h4>
    <p>Interesting and quite disturbing story of a woman's decision to become a vegetarian. Set in Korea and told in three parts from three different perspectives, the story touches on themes of shame, control, desire and mental illness. I love the way Han Kang writes, it is honestly mesmerizing. Slight trigger warning though, SA.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/onearth.jpg" alt="On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</h2>
    <h4>Ocean Vuong, 2019</h4>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most beautiful books I've ever read, written in letter-form as an intimate story of generational trauma, identity, queerness and immigration. Ocean Vuong writes so incredibly beautiful books and poems, I recommend everything he writes, truly.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/onehundred.jpg" alt="The One Hundred Nights of Hero book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The One Hundred Nights of Hero</h2>
    <h4>Isabel Greenberg, 2016</h4>
    <p>Extremely funny and beautiful graphic novel full of stories told from women's perspective. The artwork is so interesting and the stories are funny, sweet, sad, magical and folktale-like.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/persepolis.jpg" alt="Persepolis book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Persepolis</h2>
    <h4>Marjane Satrapi, 2000-2003</h4>
    <p>Another really cool graphic novel telling the story of the Iranian revolution from the perspective of young Marjane. Very cool black and white artwork and beautiful story of resilience and solidarity.</p>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/lefthandofdarkness.jpg" alt="The Left Hand of Darkness">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>The Left Hand of Darkness</h2>
    <h4>Ursula K. Le Guin, 1969</h4>
    <p>Also a great Ursula Le Guin book, still set in the same universe as her other scifi novels. Very interesting take on gender, although some criticism is appropriate. If you like books with a bit of gender-fuckery I recommend this one.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="review">
  <img src="img/wetheanimals.jpg" alt="We the Animals book cover">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>We the Animals</h2>
    <h4>Justin Torres, 2011</h4>
    <p>Beautiful queer coming-of-age story that explores themes of violence, family bonds, childhood trauma, siblinghood and sexuality. Not a light read, but incredibly moving.</p>
